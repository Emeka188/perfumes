Akunne Cosmetics — Local site

Files added/updated:
- `cosmetics.html` — single page site
- `cosmetics.css` — styles
- `cosmetics.js` — frontend logic (products, cart simulation, forms)

How to try locally:
1. Open `cosmetics.html` in your browser. No server is required for static features.
2. Add items to cart and use the Checkout button to simulate an order (saved to `localStorage`).

Deployment:
- For static hosting (GitHub Pages), push changes to `main` branch and enable GitHub Pages for this repo.
- If you want a real checkout/API, I can add a Node/Express backend and persistent DB next.
