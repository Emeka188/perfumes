Python starter

Run the example script `hello.py`:

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
python .\hello.py
```

What the script teaches:
- reading input with `input()`
- printing with `print()` and f-strings
- basic arithmetic and variables
- lists and `for` loops
- defining and using functions
- try/except for input validation

Try these exercises:
1. Modify the `colors` list and print additional details.
2. Add a function that returns the factorial of a number.
3. Save the user's answers to a file `answers.txt`.
